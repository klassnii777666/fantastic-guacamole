<u><strong>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</strong></u><br>

<br>
<u>Information While Using Samsung account and our Services</u><br>
<br>
In order for you to use our Services, certain information needs to be collected by us, as explained below.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Sync and Backup Features:</strong><br>
<br>
• <strong>Sync and back up data</strong> : You can sync, back up and restore your data on mobile devices and Smart TVs. For example, you can choose to back up or sync certain data to our cloud service (such as Samsung Cloud for your mobile devices). The data you choose to back up or sync will automatically be sent to and stored by Samsung. These data may include downloaded apps, Call and Text history, your Contacts list, appointment and alert settings you have saved (such as Calendar, Notes, Clock and Reminder entries), your Gallery and Bookmarks on Samsung Internet. For Smart TVs, these data may include postal code and broadcast information (such as service provider, channel information and antenna type), device, Smart TV (including PIN) and Samsung account profile information, settings and configurations. For Gallery sync, this feature is offered through Microsoft OneDrive. If you turn on syncing on one device where you are logged into your Samsung account, sync will automatically turn on in your other devices where you have logged into your Samsung account. You can manage your sync preferences in the Samsung account settings in any of your devices.<br>
• <strong>Call and text on other devices</strong> : By enabling “Call &amp; text on other devices”, we collect information such as Contacts and call and message logs so you can experience multi-device communication by allowing you to send or receive calls or messages on your secondary device(s). Your messages and calls will also need to be collected to sync that data to your secondary device(s).<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Membership Benefits:</strong><br>
<br>
• <strong>Save payment information</strong> : When you register your credit card to your Samsung account for easier payment options, we collect information such as credit card number, name and expiration date. Also, when you save information like your address for faster checkout when you make purchases on your mobile device, Smart TV or Samsung websites, we collect the information you choose to submit.<br>
• <strong>Samsung Rewards</strong> : By having a Samsung account, various coupons, discounts, and gift cards are available to you, when you choose to avail yourself of this feature. You are also eligible to receive Rewards points when purchasing various Samsung products and services on Samsung.com.<br>
Information regarding your logged-in purchase history, as well as information regarding the rewards available to you, including points and how and where you spend or redeem them, are collected by us.<br>
• <strong>Samsung Members App</strong> : Content you provide through or on the Samsung Members Community, such as your profile information, posts and comments (including media you upload) and information on the products you register (including warranty information), as well as communication (including information you submit) with our customer team and other Samsung Members Community members (including the content of personal messages) is collected.<br>
• <strong>Group Sharing</strong> : Group Sharing allows you to easily send or share files and other information, such as contacts, profile information, notes, reminders, and calendar schedules to other Samsung account users, as well as displaying profile images in your contacts list and when you receive calls. We collect the media and information you choose to send, as well as your contacts and profile information (including profile information of your contacts). Other Samsung sharing features which are not a part of Samsung account will also use your contacts and profile information to allow you to share media and information through those features.<br>
When you join a group and share media and files (such as when you join a group to share notes, reminders, calendar entries, or gallery media), these entries will be visible to all other members of the group. You can delete or edit gallery, calendar, and reminder entries at any time while you are a member of the group. For shared note entries, you may edit and delete entries if granted permission by the group leader. Other members may be able to edit or delete your shared entry.<br>
If you leave or are removed from a group, your shared entries which have not been deleted will remain in the group for other members to see and edit.<br>
• <strong>Quick Share</strong> : The Quick Share feature, available on certain Galaxy devices, enables you to quickly share photos, videos, and files. Quick Share can be used to share content between Galaxy devices in close proximity to each other via the device-to-device method. Quick Share can also be used to share content by sending a link that can be used to access the shared content using any internet-connected device. When using this method, we collect the content you share, which will remain available for 3 days before it is automatically deleted. You can also add extra protection, such as file encryption, by using the private sharing option, which allows you to set an expiration date and revoke access to your content. By using this feature, the content you share with a recipient will be deleted from our server immediately after the recipient receives and downloads it. Please note that content sent by private sharing will be held on an encrypted server for up to 7 days until either the recipient downloads the content, or the content expires in 7 days, whichever is earlier.<br>
• <strong>Samsung Visit-In</strong> : When you are near participating Samsung or third-party stores offering benefits or coupons, information about the store offering benefits or coupons will be collected. With your separate consent, your device’s location information, such as the GPS signal or information about nearby Wi-Fi access points and mobile phone masts, is sent to us when you choose to enable this feature.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Security Services:</strong><br>
<br>
• <strong>Samsung Pass</strong> : When you save your information (e.g., name, phone number, email, postal or shipping address), you can easily fill in and use for various participating Samsung or third-party apps, websites or services. Also, you can choose to back up user IDs and passwords, which enables you to log in using biometric authentication to those apps, websites or services without having to remember your ID or password. The number of successful and unsuccessful authentication attempts is also collected. Biometric information is only stored on your device and Samsung does not collect or have access to this information.<br>
• <strong>SmartThings Find/Samsung Find</strong> : SmartThings Find/Samsung Find allows you to locate your devices when you consent to the processing of location information, including lost devices that are not connected to a network. When you request the location of any of your devices logged in to your Samsung account or other Samsung devices that connect to your Samsung account (such as your wearable device), and if the device is turned on and you have agreed to Samsung’s processing of your location information, the location of each device is sent to Samsung to show your device(s) on a map. In certain instances (such as when you want to share the location of your device with other users when using Samsung SmartThings), SmartThings Find/Samsung Find allows you to share your device’s location with other Samsung account users.<br>
<br>
SmartThings Find/Samsung Find also has several optional features which you can turn on, as described below.<br>
<br>
i. <u>Send Last Location</u>: Your device’s last location will be automatically sent to Samsung whenever your device’s battery reaches a critically low level (5% or lower) to help you find the device even after it’s turned off.<br>
ii. <u>Offline Finding</u> : This feature will activate if your device remains disconnected from its mobile or Wi-Fi network after a certain period of time. You will be able to locate it using Bluetooth with the help of other nearby Samsung devices, which also have Offline Finding enabled. By enabling this feature, your device will also help others find their lost devices around you by using your device’s location. No information about you will be visible to others, nor will others’ information be visible to you. Your device, together with other enabled devices, will simply create a Bluetooth network to work together and locate the lost device.<br>
iii. <u>Lost Mode</u> : If you turn on this feature, you can save your contact information and any messages so that if you lose your device, Samsung Find can show the information you provided to the person who finds your lost device. The information you provide directly when you set Lost Mode on your lost device is collected, which includes your email address, phone number, username, and the messages that you want to show.<br>
• <strong>SmartThings Find</strong> : SmartThings Find may require you to register for Samsung SmartThings. For more information about how Samsung SmartThings processes your information, please review the Samsung SmartThings <a href="https://www.smartthings.com/privacypolicy" target="_blank">Privacy Notice</a>.<br>
• <strong>Secure Wi-Fi</strong> : Data transmitted from your device when using a public network, for example at a coffee shop or airport terminal, will have an extra layer of security during its transit. Secure Wi-Fi offers various subscription plans depending on the amount of data you need protected. When you do subscribe to one of the Secure Wi-Fi subscription plans, information will be collected related to that subscription plan (such as which product is purchased and how and when the product was purchased).<br>
• <strong>Digital Key</strong> : Information related to the keys are collected, such as the manufacturer, device information and key information.<br>
• <strong>Knox Matrix</strong> : Store your keys used in some Samsung services securely on the server and make them accessible only on authenticated device(s). It extracts authentication information by processing the PIN, pattern, or password set on the lock screen. This authentication information is collected and cannot infer the PIN, pattern, or password.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Advanced intelligence</strong><br>
<br>
With advanced intelligence, certain apps or services will use your inputs to provide intelligence features. Some of the apps or services process your data solely within your device, while others require the collection of your data, such as your account information, device and app information, and your inputs (including text or media files), to produce results. For example, some of the apps or services may provide recommendations for you. You can check which apps and services offer advanced intelligence by going into your Samsung account settings and clicking the advanced intelligence tab.<br>
<br>
Prior to using the advanced intelligence feature within an app or service that requires the collection of your data, you will be informed prior to your initial use of such feature.<br>
<br>
For apps or services where advanced intelligence requires the collection of your data, some of those apps or services may provide the option to use advanced intelligence without your data being collected in its settings.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Voice Assistant</strong><br>
<br>
Bixby Voice will collect data needed to carry out your commands, such as voice inputs and information related to the apps or services that are affected by the command (e.g., your Calendar app if you ask Bixby to add a date to your calendar). Bixby Voice also offers various optional features that collect certain information when you use such features. To see more details about the types of data Bixby Voice collects and how that data is used, please see the Bixby Voice <a href="https://d264isyiyrfhr3.cloudfront.net/storage/tos/glb/2.1.2/1699492417863/eng/glb_eng_pp.html" target="_blank">Privacy Notice</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Parental Controls</strong><br>
<br>
Parental Controls is a feature available to Samsung account users who create an account for their child, create a Family group, or receive permission from the Family group creator to change the settings in Parental Controls. Parental Controls allows you to protect minor account users by limiting access and use of certain services and apps. For example, you can limit the ability for them to user certain Samsung apps or services. If you use Parental Controls, we will collect the settings you set.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Account and Service Linking:</strong><br>
<br>
Certain third-party apps or services may allow for the linking of your Samsung account to that third-party account, allowing for easy login. In addition, you may also have the option to link certain Samsung Services with third-party apps or services to access enhanced existing features or whole new features all together (for example, when you link Samsung Cloud with Microsoft One Drive, you can begin backing up files to One Drive). The information collected and how that information will be used will be shown to you prior to any account or service linking. Third-party websites, apps, services and features may operate independently from us and may have their own privacy notices or policies. We recommend that you review them to ensure that you understand how they process your information, as well as review this Privacy Notice to know how we process your information. To the extent that any such linked or shown website, app, service or other feature is not owned or controlled by us, we are not responsible for its content, use, or privacy practices.<br>

<br>
In addition, we may also process your data based on your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we will stop processing the data that relies on that consent, but it will not impact the processing of data collected prior to your withdrawal until the purposes for which such data was collected have been achieved.<br>
<br>
Please note that although we aim to retain your data for the time period described above, your data may be processed longer pursuant to applicable law. For example, if a specific statute mandates we require a certain piece of data, we will comply and retain that data until the required retention period expires.<br>
<br>
As long as your data is retained by us, your data will always be subject to appropriate safeguards.<br>
<br>
